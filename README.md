SHOUTOUS TO VIVI'S RADIO!

This is a simple Python-Programm to play to Radio from your Desktop!
Just click Play/Pause, you can enable the Video-Stream and change the volume!

Requires Python to be installed on your PC, and you have to run the following in your CMD:
pip install python-vlc yt-dlp requests beautifulsoup4

to start the programm, create a simple .bat link. I use the following:
@echo off
python "C:\Path\to\your\file\vivi-vgm-player.py"
pause

(The UI is in German, but you can change it easily in the code)
